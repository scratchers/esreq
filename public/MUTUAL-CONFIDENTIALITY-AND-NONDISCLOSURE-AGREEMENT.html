<p align="justify" style="style1">             
This Confidentiality and Nondisclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into between Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a Delaware 
corporation having its principal place of business at 702 SW 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas, 72716 and the Board of Trustees of 
the University of Arkansas acting for and on behalf of the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville campus, having its place of business 
at 120 Ozark Hall, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 72701 ("University") (each a "Party" and together the "Parties").
</P>
<p align="justify">
WHEREAS, one or both of the Parties wish to receive certain Confidential Information (as defined below) from the other for the purpose 
of student, faculty and staff education and research at the University of Arkansas.
</p>
<p align="justify">
WHEREAS, one or both of the Parties will disclose (each a "Disclosing Party") Confidential Information to the other Party 
(each a "Receiving Party"), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
</p>
<p align="justify">
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein set forth, the Parties agree as follows:
<ol>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">Definition of Confidential Information. The Confidential Information that the Disclosing Party is supplying to the Receiving Party under 
	this Agreement is described generally as information relating to the Disclosing Party's computer and information systems, accounting and 
	other financial information, insurance, associate relations and other human resource information, marketing and merchandising information 
	including current and future product information, and general proprietary business information ("Confidential Information"). Confidential 
	Information shall specifically include, but not be limited to: ____________________________________________________
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">
	Use of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may use Confidential Information for the purpose of determining whether to enter into a 
	formal business relationship with the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party further agrees not to use Confidential Information for any purpose, 
	except that set forth above. The University may publish scientific papers relating to its research provided (i) that such publication does not 
	reveal and Confidential Information provided by or otherwise owned by Wal-Mart as the Disclosing Party and (ii) that University shall furnish to 
	Disclosing Party thirty (30) days prior to publication a written description of the subject matter of the publication in order to permit Disclosing 
	Party to review, comment, object thereto, and/or consult with the author(s).
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">
	Duty to Protect. The Receiving Party shall have a duty to protect Confidential Information that is (a) marked or accompanied by documents clearly 
	and conspicuously designated as "confidential" or "proprietary"; (b) identified orally or in writing by the Disclosing Party as confidential before, 
	during or promptly after the presentation or communication; or (c) is not generally known in the industry in which the Disclosing Party is or may 
	become engaged and which would reasonably be considered confidential and/or proprietary. The Receiving Party's duty shall last for a period of 
	five (5) years, then the duty shall last until the business relationship is terminated.
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">
	Standard of Care. The Receiving Party shall protect the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with the same degree of care, but no less than 
	a reasonable degree of care, as the Receiving Party normally uses in the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information. The Receiving 
	Party shall use this standard of care to prevent the unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination, or publication of the Disclosing Party's Confidential 
	Information. Furthermore, the Parties represent that their respective current employees, as a condition of employment are subject to the terms and conditions 
	of this Agreement and have been informed of the terms of this Agreement; and that each Party will enforce this Agreement against any current or former 
	employee who discloses, or is reasonably likely to disclose Confidential Information.
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">
	Exclusions. The restrictions set forth shall not apply with respect to Confidential Information that: (a) is already available to the public; (b) becomes 
	available to the public through no fault of the Receiving Party, its officers, agents, or employees; (c) is already known to the Receiving Party at the 
	time that the Confidential Information is received from the Disclosing Party; (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without breach of 
	this Agreement; (e) is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (f) is disclosed by the Receiving 
	Party with the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; or (g) is required to be disclosed pursuant to law. If a Receiving Party is required by a 
	government body or court of law to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party agrees to give the Disclosing Party reasonable advance notice 
	so that the Disclosing Party may contest the disclosure or seek a protective order.
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">
	Proprietary Interest. Neither Party acquires any rights in the other Party's Confidential Information under this Agreement except the limited rights
	 necessary to carry out the purposes set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement grants no license by either Party to the other, either directly or 
	 by implication, estoppel or otherwise. This Agreement is not intended, nor shall it be construed, to confer any right upon any person or entity not 
	 a Party to this Agreement.
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">
	Warranty. Each Disclosing Party warrants that it has the right to make the disclosures under this Agreement. NO OTHER WARRANTIES ARE MADE BY EITHER PARTY
	 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. ANY INFORMATION EXCHANGED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS PROVIDED "AS IS."	
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">
	Term and Termination. This Agreement shall become effective as of the Effective Date and terminate automatically at the conclusion of the Party's discussions
	 regarding a formal business relationship or, if formalized, at the end of the Party's relationship; provided, however, that termination of this Agreement 
	 shall not relieve the Receiving Party of any of the obligations set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information. 
	 Immediately upon termination of this Agreement or upon written request of the Disclosing Party at any time and for any reason, the Receiving Party shall 
	 return to the Disclosing Party all of its Confidential Information in the Receiving Party's possession, along with all copies, or, if requested, the 
	 Receiving Party shall certify in writing that all such Confidential Information has been destroyed.	
	</p></li>
	<li><p align="justify">Miscellaneous.

			Parties, including University students.  The Receiving Party agrees that all Confidential Information will only be made known to employees of 
			the Receiving Party who have a need to know such Confidential Information.  Acknowledgments of the obligations of the Agreement by the appropriate 
			employees of the Receiving Party shall be in the form of Appendix A which is attached hereto.  Such acknowledgments are incorporated herein by reference.
